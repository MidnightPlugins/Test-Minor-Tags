# Test-Minor-Tags
Mission diagnostic tool for the Endless Sky video game.

This plugin contains two jobs. (accessible from the job board)

One tests whether missions with the minor tag can start. 

The other blocks missions with the minor tag from starting.

This is only a tool for detecting if the active plugins/PRs contain repeating missions that block missions with the minor tag.
